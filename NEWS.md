# PMXFrem 1.2.9

* **`calcEtas()`**: Refactored for improved usability. The function can now optionally create the `FFEMdata` object internally when supplied with `dataFile`, `parNames`, etc., removing the need for a separate `createFFEMdata()` call. Also corrected internal argument handling to prevent `unused argument` errors when `...` is used (e.g., for `availCov`).
* **`traceplot()`**: Added a new feature to display a shaded chi-squared acceptance region on the OFV plot to help visualize convergence stability. This is controlled by the new arguments `includeShapedOFV`, `pvalue`, `df`, and `meanShapeLastIter`. Also fixed a bug where validation for these new arguments incorrectly used `error()` instead of the correct `stop()` function.

# PMXFrem 1.2.8

## BUG FIXES & QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

* Greatly improved test coverage across the package, with most core functions now exceeding 90% coverage.
* Fixed numerous bugs and edge cases in `updateFREMmodel()`, `createFREMData()`, and `calcFFEM()` that were discovered through the expanded test suite.
* Refactored tests to run in a self-contained manner, eliminating side effects such as writing files to the project directory.
* Resolved test inconsistencies across different R versions by updating and stabilizing test snapshots.
* devtools::check() pass without errors.

# PMXFrem 1.2.7

* Made it possible to use type=0 in `getExplainedVar()` together with a function that returns multiple values.

# PMXFrem 1.2.6

* Made it possible to use availCov to specify the covariates to be used for the derivation of TOTCOVVAR.
* Changed the default in plotExplainedVar so tha the main effects ordering is based on the mean instead of the median.
* Added the argument reordFun to specify the reordering function for the main effects ordering.
    
# PMXFrem 1.2.5

* Added traceplot() and fixed a bug in createFFEMdata().

# PMXFrem 1.2.4

* Fixed the situation when you have more etas than base thetas, which may occur if you have skipped omegas for etas not associated with thetas.

# PMXFrem 1.2.3

* Made it possible to omit sigma in fremParameterTable by setting sigmaNum and sigmaLabel to NULL.
* Made it possible to not have ffem OMEGAS in fremParameterTable

# PMXFrem 1.2.2

Removed the import of an non-public package.

# PMXFrem 1.2.1

Fixed bug in addFremCovariates.

# PMXFrem 1.2.0

This release prepares PMXFrem for public release. Some feature additions. bug
fixes and much improved documentation (not the least that a majority of the
examples in the help files are now executable).

## New or revised functionality
* Added setupdfCovs() fuction that facilitates the creation of the dfCovs for getExplainedVar().
* Moved getForestDFREM() from PMXForest to PMXFrem.
* Added a parameter table function (fremParTable())
* Made parNames mandatory for createFFEMmodel()
* Some harmonization of arguments across functions.
* Added a ':' between the parameter name and the FFEM expression in the output from calcFFEM.

## Bug fixes and error handling and prevention
* Added an input check to getExplainedVar() so that dataI and etas must have the
same number of rows if type=1
* Fixed the potential issue with misalignment between panels and facet labels in 
plotExplainedVar().
* Updated unit tests for many functions.

## Documentation
* Extensive updates to the help file documentation.
* Made many examples in the help page documentation directly executable.
* Updated some of the vignettes.
* Linting and other cleaning of source code
* Cleaned up repository directory
* Various other editorial changes.
