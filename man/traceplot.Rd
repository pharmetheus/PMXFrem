\title{Create traceplots of OFV, tehtas and omegas from a NONMEM run.}
\usage{
traceplot(
  runno = NULL,
  modName = NULL,
  modDevDir = NULL,
  extFileName = NULL,
  set = 1,
  startIter = 10,
  main = NULL,
  includeOFV = TRUE,
  includeTheta = TRUE,
  includeOmega = TRUE,
  thetaNum = NULL,
  omegaNum = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{runno}{The run number. Must be provided if \code{modName} is NULL. Will be
used to create NONMEM model and results file names  with the structure
run#.mod and run#. NONMEM ext, phi and cov files will be assumed to be
named run# followed by the appropriate suffix (where # is \code{runno}).}

\item{modName}{The model name. Will be used together with \code{modExt}, \code{lstExt},
ext, phi and cov to form the NONMEM file names, for example
\code{modName}.mod for the model file.}

\item{modDevDir}{The directory where the files reside. Default is the current
directory, i.e. ".".}

\item{set}{The TABLE in the file the iteration information should be
extracted from. Will use the last TABLE if set to \code{NULL}. There is one
TABLE for each \code{$ESTIMATION} in the \code{NONMEM} model file.}

\item{omegaNum}{}
}
\description{
Typically used for NONMEM runs implemented with EM algorithms to check for a stable convergence.
