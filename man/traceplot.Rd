\title{Create traceplots of OFV, tehtas and omegas from a NONMEM run.}
\usage{
traceplot(
  runno = NULL,
  modName = NULL,
  modDevDir = NULL,
  extFileName = NULL,
  set = 1,
  startIter = 10,
  main = NULL,
  includeOFV = TRUE,
  includeTheta = TRUE,
  includeOmega = TRUE,
  thetaNum = NULL,
  omegaNum = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{runno}{The run number. Must be provided if \code{modName} is NULL. Will be
used to create NONMEM model and results file names  with the structure
run#.mod and run#. NONMEM ext, phi and cov files will be assumed to be
named run# followed by the appropriate suffix (where # is \code{runno}).}

\item{modName}{The model name. Will be used together with \code{modExt}, \code{lstExt},
ext, phi and cov to form the NONMEM file names, for example
\code{modName}.mod for the model file.}

\item{modDevDir}{The directory where the files reside. Default is the current
directory, i.e. ".".}

\item{set}{The TABLE in the file the iteration information should be
extracted from. Will use the last TABLE if set to \code{NULL}. There is one
TABLE for each \code{$ESTIMATION} in the \code{NONMEM} model file.}

\item{startIter}{The iteration to start the traceplot from. Default is 10.
(The first iterations are typically not particularly informative.)}

\item{main}{The title to use in the generated plots. Default is NULL.}

\item{includeOFV}{Logical (default is \code{TRUE}). Should the traceplot for OFV be included?}

\item{includeTheta}{Logical (default is \code{TRUE}). Should the traceplot for the \code{THETA}s be included?}

\item{includeOmega}{Logical (default is \code{TRUE}). Should the traceplot for the \code{OMEGA}s be included?}

\item{thetaNum}{The number of the \code{THETA}s to include in the plot. Default is NULL, which means that all \code{THETA}s should be included.}

\item{omegaNum}{The number of the \code{OMEGA}s to include in the plot. Default is NULL, which means that all \code{OMEGA}s should be included.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects, one for each of OFV, \code{THETA}s and code{OMEGA}s.
}
\description{
Use to check for a stable convergence of NONMEM runs, typically for runs
implemented with EM algorithms.
}
\details{
Each of the parameters and OFV are plotted versus the iteration number.
The value on the y-axis is normalised to the last iteration.
