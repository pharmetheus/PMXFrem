\title{Get the covariate names from a FREM model file}
\usage{
getCovNames(modFile, keepComment = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{modFile}{The name of the FREM model file}

\item{keepComment}{If FALSE (default), remove the leading ; and white space
in front of the covariate name in the model file.}
}
\value{
A list with three components:
\itemize{
\item covNames = the names of the covariates as given in the model file. These
corresponds to the covariate column names in the FREM data set created by
PsN.
\item polyCatCovs = the name of the dichotomized covariates created by PsN.
\item orgCovNames = original covariate names (removing the frem specific ones)
}
}
\description{
Figure out the FREM covariate names from a FREM model file. It
relies on the covariate names added by PsN in the FREM code.
}
\examples{

covList <- getCovNames(modFile = system.file("extData/SimNeb/run31.mod", package = "PMXFrem"))
